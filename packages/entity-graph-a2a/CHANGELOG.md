## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- v3.0.0 — Universal Platform Evolution

  Evolves the React-only entity graph into a cross-platform, multi-framework,
  AI-native, local-first ecosystem.
  - **Monorepo split (breaking, but consumer-safe):** the framework-agnostic core
    is extracted into `@prometheus-ags/entity-graph-core` (zero React). The
    published `@prometheus-ags/prometheus-entity-management` package is the React
    binding over the vanilla core. Existing React hook names remain available,
    while core-only imperative consumers migrate from `useGraphStore.getState()`
    to `graphStore.getState()`; the deprecated core alias remains through the
    next-major removal window.
  - **New framework bindings:** `entity-graph-svelte` (Svelte 5 runes),
    `entity-graph-solid`, `entity-graph-web-components` (Lit 3), `entity-graph-alpine`,
    `entity-graph-htmx` (Node SSE fragment server).
  - **Peer sync:** `entity-graph-sync` with a pluggable SyncProvider — Yjs (default)
    and Loro (reusing the 2.2.0 merge seam).
  - **AI-native:** `entity-graph-a2a` plus `a2ui-react` with official A2UI
    v0.9.1 rendering and default-deny graph actions; legacy
    EntityChat/Copilot/Stream/Diff/Approval APIs live under `./ag-ui`.
  - **A2A v1 (breaking):** the package root now serves the official A2A v1
    JSON-RPC discovery, task, streaming, subscription, and cancellation
    lifecycle through `@a2a-js/sdk@1.0.1`. Authentication and a caller-scoped
    default-deny application policy run before graph mutation. Pre-v3
    `/tasks/*` slash methods and alpha handler shapes move to the explicit
    `@prometheus-ags/entity-graph-a2a/legacy` migration subpath. REST, gRPC,
    push notifications, and extension signing are not declared capabilities.
  - **Codegen contract:** `entity-graph-sdl` (schema → validated IR).
  - **Native (published outside npm):** `entity-graph-cli` + `entity-graph-mcp`
    (Rust, via crates.io), `entity-graph-tauri` (Tauri v2 plugin), and
    `entity_graph_flutter` (Riverpod 3, via pub.dev).

  All integrations ship as optional peer dependencies; the core bundle stays
  `zustand + immer`.
