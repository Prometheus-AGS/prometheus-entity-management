# Prometheus Entity Skills

A comprehensive skill suite for building entity-driven React applications with
`@prometheus-ags/prometheus-entity-management`, plus shared contract guidance
for the canonical `entity_graph_flutter` companion. The current invokable
sub-skills target the React stack; Flutter work must load the Dart reference
instead of translating React hooks literally.

## Architecture

All sub-skills enforce the library's canonical data flow:

```
Components → Hooks → Stores → APIs
```

- **Components** compose UI only — no direct store or API access
- **Hooks** (`useEntityCRUD`, `useEntityView`, etc.) mediate all data operations
- **Stores** (Zustand entity graph) are the single source of truth
- **APIs** handle server communication and are called only through hooks

## Sub-Skills

## Typical Workflow

1. `/entity-graph-init` — Set up the entity graph store
2. `/entity-prisma-setup` — Generate entity configs from Prisma schema
3. `/entity-crud-page` — Scaffold CRUD pages per entity
4. `/entity-gql-setup` — Wire GraphQL if applicable
5. `/entity-realtime-setup` — Add realtime sync if needed
6. `/entity-audit` — Verify architecture compliance

For Flutter source-lineage or adaptation claims, load the Flutter source provenance reference and require `pnpm run verify:flutter-source-provenance`; provenance never certifies the Dart runtime, rendered Flutter, or publication.

For Dart graph, Riverpod, Flutter-library, optional FFI, or public Dart API
claims, load the Dart graph reference and require the static
`pnpm run verify:dart-graph-riverpod` contract plus `pnpm run
verify:dart-exports`; neither is behavioral test evidence. For the optional
repository-source DevTools entry, also load the Flutter DevTools controller
reference and require the full assembled `pnpm run
verify:devtools-flutter-controller` acceptance flow. Keep its
controller/VM-service evidence separate from the pending extension UI and from
the published pub.dev `3.0.1` payload.

For the complete Flutter/Riverpod/A2UI application, load the Flutter showcase
reference too. Preserve the one-graph/provider/transport layering and atomic
default-deny A2UI boundary. Analyzer, unit, widget, provider, golden, and other
partial checks are not test evidence; require the complete assembled
host/device acceptance receipt for behavioral claims.

For Tauri plugin, IPC, capability, generated-binding, or Android/iOS claims,
load the Tauri reference and require `pnpm run verify:tauri-plugin` plus the
Tauri package `verify:skills` gate. Keep `entity-graph-tauri:default` read-only,
do not describe the in-memory snapshot mirror as durable SQLite, and never use
desktop or packed-source proof as Android/iOS runtime certification.

For the complete universal Tauri application, also load the universal example
reference. Preserve one React frontend, one canonical normalized graph, the
component-to-hook-to-store-to-service boundary, SQL-owned durability, and the
default-deny deep-link/capability policy. Focused unit, MockRuntime, or source
checks do not authorize browser visual, desktop bundle, Android/iOS application,
registry, or stable-release claims.

For React 19/Vite 8 showcase or React-first RC readiness claims, load the React
showcase reference and require `pnpm run bdd:vite-react19`. Preserve its
source-workspace evidence boundary; for installability or registry claims also
require new packed-candidate and immutable RC-rehearsal receipts.

For Flint realtime, authentication, JWKS, or Forge provisioning claims, load
the Flint portable-contract reference and require
`pnpm run verify:flint-contracts`. Keep service-role material out of client
code, do not generalize RSA compatibility to EC, and do not claim a Forge
adapter. The manual live lane proves only its exact pinned source revisions.

When a task makes a 3.0 compatibility or publication claim, load the 3.0 release contract reference first. For dependency-currentness or vulnerability claims, also follow its links to `release/dependency-policy.json` and `security/advisory-policy.json`. For npm module or type claims, require the packed-candidate procedure in `release/package-contracts.md`; workspace aliases are not release evidence. For cross-binding singleton claims, require `pnpm run verify:binding-singletons`. For PGlite/Loro durability, convergence, or reconnect claims, read the certified sync reference and require `pnpm run test:sync-persistence` plus `pnpm run verify:sync-persistence`; persistence, CRDT merge, graph projection, and transport recovery are separate receipts. For official A2UI work, read the A2UI bridge reference, use the package root for official v0.9.1 only, move alpha chat/state APIs to `./ag-ui`, and require explicit application authority after protocol validation. For A2A work, read the A2A conformance reference, use the package root for official v1 JSON-RPC and `./legacy` only for pre-v3 slash-method migration, require `pnpm run test:a2a-conformance`, `pnpm run verify:a2a-conformance`, and the pinned TCK receipt, and never infer application authority from protocol validity. For Tauri work, preserve the four separate gates for public declarations, Rust-derived bindings, webview capability authority, and platform-native execution. For example-coverage claims, read the shared contract and require `pnpm run verify:example-coverage`; semantic evidence is a flight plan, not framework, browser, device, accessibility, or visual certification. Treat `planned` entries in `examples/coverage.json` as work remaining. An `implemented` showcase proves only the commands and paths declared on that entry; it does not automatically prove packed installation, another platform, or publication authority.

For an end-to-end A2A-to-A2UI application, load the agentic example reference
in addition to both protocol references. Keep the deterministic reference
agent keyless, make external endpoints explicit opt-ins, route rendered actions
through exact schemas plus application authorization and human approval, and
require `pnpm run verify:agentic-a2ui` before claiming rendered,
accessible, or visual showcase evidence.

For release-candidate planning, rehearsal, staging, or recovery, load the
release-candidate pipeline reference and require the non-mutating release
pipeline tests. Do not infer npm trusted-publisher configuration, GitHub
environment approval, registry mutation, `latest`, or stable 3.0.0 from a
passing local gate.
